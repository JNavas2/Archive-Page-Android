Archive Page (formerly Share2Archive) is an Android™ app that lets you quickly archive web pages using Archive Today.
Share links from any Android app, and preserve content with a single tap.

(Archive Today is a time capsule for web pages. It takes a 'snapshot' of a webpage that will always be online even if the original page disappears. It saves a text and a graphical copy of the page for better accuracy and provides a short and reliable link to an unalterable record of the web page.)

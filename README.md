## Archive Page (formerly Share2Archive) app for Android™

**Archive Page** is an Android app that lets you quickly archive web pages using Archive Today. 
Share links from any Android app, and preserve content with a single tap.   
(Archive Today is a time capsule for web pages. It takes a 'snapshot' of a webpage that will always be online even if the original page disappears. It saves a text and a graphical copy of the page for better accuracy and provides a short and reliable link to an unalterable record of the web page.)
